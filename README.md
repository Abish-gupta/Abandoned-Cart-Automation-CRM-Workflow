### Problem
E-commerce businesses lose significant revenue because customers often leave without completing orders, making it hard for teams to track and recover these abandoned carts. Manual recovery efforts are slow, expensive, and rarely succeed.

---

### Solution Overview

This project automates the entire cart recovery flow â€” from detecting abandoned carts, to sending WhatsApp notifications, and alerting calling teams in real-time. All recovery activities and success rates are tracked on a central dashboard.
