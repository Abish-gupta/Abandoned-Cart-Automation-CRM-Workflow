## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **abandoned cart recovery automation system** that integrates customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities with intelligent email marketing workflows. The system automatically detects when customers abandon their shopping carts and triggers a series of personalized recovery campaigns designed to re-engage customers and increase conversion rates.

The workflow combines real-time cart tracking, customer behavior analysis, automated email sequences, and detailed performance analytics to create a complete solution for e-commerce businesses looking to recover lost sales opportunities.

### Key Business Value
- **Automated Recovery**: Reduces manual intervention in cart recovery processes by 95%
- **Personalization**: Delivers targeted messaging based on customer behavior and cart contents
- **Performance Tracking**: Provides comprehensive analytics to optimize recovery campaigns
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles high-volume e-commerce operations with real-time processing

## How To Reproduce

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- SQL Server/PostgreSQL database
- Redis server
- SendGrid account with API key
- Email testing tools (optional: MailHog for local testing)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abish-gupta/Abandoned-Cart-Automation-CRM-Workflow.git
cd Abandoned-Cart-Automation-CRM-Workflow

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Database Configuration

```bash
# Initialize database schema
python scripts/setup_database.py

# Load sample data
python scripts/load_dummy_data.py
```

### Step 3: Configuration Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/crm_workflow
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Email Service Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourcompany.com

# Application Settings
ABANDONMENT_THRESHOLD_MINUTES=30
CAMPAIGN_INTERVALS=15,60,1440  # 15min, 1hr, 24hr
DEBUG_MODE=True
```

### Step 4: Dummy Data Setup

The system includes comprehensive dummy data for testing:

```bash
# Generate sample customers (1000 records)
python dummy_data/generate_customers.py

# Create sample products and cart sessions
python dummy_data/generate_products.py
python dummy_data/generate_cart_sessions.py

# Simulate abandonment events
python dummy_data/simulate_abandonments.py --count=100
```

### Step 5: Start the Application

```bash
# Start the main application
python app.py

# In separate terminals, start background workers
celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
celery -A app.celery beat --loglevel=info

# Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5000
